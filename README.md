# Handheld AR application using AR.js and A-Frame

The application can be found here: https://georgebeeley.github.io/AR.js/.

The purpose of this project is to create an application that enables the visualisation of periodic table elements in augmented reality using positionable real-world markers. Upon close proximity of the two markers, which will be have molecules positioned atop them in the virtual scene, they should animatedly combine to create a compound element of the two starting molecules.

The application design intends to allow the expansion of the libray of elements from the periodic table, and the compound element possibilites.

Current usage requires the markers shown below:

Marker A                   |  Marker B
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

Images can be downloaded and used as targets without printing by displaying them on your monitor. Being able to reposition the markers is necessary for the applications features as they interact based on proximity to eachother.
